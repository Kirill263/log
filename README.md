In the "Event Type" and "Error Code" window, you can enter filter values for the event log. Here's what you can enter in each field:

- In the "Event Type" field: Enter an integer representing the type of event you want to filter. For example, to filter all errors, enter the value 2, to filter warnings - 4, etc. Leave the field empty if you don't want to filter by event type.

- In the "Error Code" field: Enter an integer representing the specific error code that you want to filter. For example, to filter events with error code 1000, enter the value 1000. Leave the field empty if you don't want to filter by error code.

Fill in these fields according to the required filters to view the event log.
